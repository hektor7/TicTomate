My own JavaFx 8 app for Pomodoro's working technique.

## What is The Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is an interesting and easy way to increase your productivity and improve your results. This technique consists on to divide your work flow in 25 minutes blocks separated by 5 minutes for rest, read email, whatsapp or facebook. This entails avoid distractions in our 25 minutes of work and focus these distractions in our 5 minutes of resting.

## Why have I created this app?

I'm a software developer at morning and a law student at night (somehow like Batman) and I don't have time enough so I thought: I must to make the most of my  time!! Then I came across with this technique. I was looking for a simple app in order to follow this technique and... this is the result. 

I created this app with JavaFx 8 because I use this app on my desktop when I'm programming but I'd like to use it on my android to study :) (right now I use desktop version too) and of course, I love to try different technologies so now I'm learning JavaFx 8 :D

## What else about this app?

This app is created with JavaFx 8, if you want to run it on your desktop you can download the last jar file from **[here](https://github.com/hektor7/TicTomate/releases)** and run it (you will need JRE 8).

This app can run on Android too but this version has major limitations and I have no published any release yet.
